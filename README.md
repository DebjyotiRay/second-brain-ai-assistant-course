## 📖 About This Course

This course is part of Decoding ML's open-source series, where we provide free hands-on resources for building GenAI and recommender systems.

The **YOUR TITLE**, in collaboration with [...](...), is a X-module course backed up by code, Notebooks and lessons that will teach you how to build an **WHAT YOU WILL BUILD** from scratch.

By the end of this course, you will know how to architect, build and deploy a **WHAT YOU WILL BUILD**.

**What you'll do:**

1. ...

🥷 With these skills, you'll become a ninja in building **WHAT YOU WILL BUILD**.

## 👥 Who Should Join?

**This course is ideal for:**
- ML/AI engineers interested in building production-ready **WHAT YOU WILL BUILD**
- Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and Software Engineers wanting to understand the engineering behind **WHAT YOU WILL BUILD**

**Note:** This course focuses on engineering practices and end-to-end system implementation rather than theoretical model optimization or research.

## 🎓 Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|
| **Skills** | Basic understanding of Python and Machine Learning. |
| **Hardware** | Any modern laptop/workstation will do the job (no GPU or powerful computing power required). We support Google Colab for free compute. |
| **Level** | Intermediate |


## 💰 Cost Structure

All tools used throughout the course will stick to their free tier, except OpenAI's API, as follows:

- ...

## 🥂 Open-source Course: Participation is Open and Free

As an open-source course, you don't have to enroll. Everything is self-paced, free of charge and with its resources freely accessible as follows:
- **code**: this GitHub repository
- **articles**: [Decoding ML](...)

## 📚 Course Outline

This **open-source course consists of X comprehensive modules** covering theory, system design, and hands-on implementation.

Our recommendation for each module:
1. Read the article.
2. Run the code to replicate our results.
3. Following the article, go deeper into the code to understand the implementation.

> [!NOTE]
> Check the [INSTALL_AND_USAGE](./INSTALL_AND_USAGE.md) doc for a step-by-step installation and usage guide.

| Module | Materials | Description | Code |
|--------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | [Building a TikTok-like recommender](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/33d3273e-b8e3-4d98-b160-c3d239343022) | Learn how to architect a recommender system using the 4-stage architecture and two-tower network. | **No code** |
| 2 | [Feature pipelines for TikTok-like recommenders](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/feature-pipeline-for-tiktok-like) | Learn how to build a scalable feature pipeline using a feature store. | •[1_fp_computing_features.ipynb](notebooks/1_fp_computing_features.ipynb) |

### Google Colab

To run the Notebooks in Google Colab, copy-paste them into your Google Drive, open them with Google Colab, and run them as running them locally. At the beginning of each Notebook, we have a set of setup steps that will **prepare the code and Python environment automatically**.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

At Decoding ML we teach how to build production ML systems, thus the course follows the structure of a real-world Python project:

```bash
.
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for each pipeline
├── .../             # Core recommender system package
│   ├── config.py       # Configuration and settings
│   ...
│   └── training/       # Training pipelines code
├── tools/              # Utility scripts
├── .env.example        # Example environment variables template
├── Makefile            # Commands to install and run the project
├── pyproject.toml      # Project dependencies
```

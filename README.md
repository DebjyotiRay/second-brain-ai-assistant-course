## üìñ About This Course

This course is part of Decoding ML's open-source series, where we provide free hands-on resources for building GenAI and information retrieval systems.

Following Decoding ML's mission, in this course we will show you how to build an end-to-end AI system using the Second Brain AI Assistant as an example.

**The Second Brain AI Assistant** open-source course contains 6 modules and it's backed up by code and lessons that will teach you how to build an **advanced RAG and LLM system using LLMOps and ML systems best practices**.

By the end of this course, you will know how to architect, build and deploy a production-ready RAG and LLM system, by building an end-to-end application from scratch.

#### So what is the Second Brain AI Assistant?

The concept of a Second Brain is a metaphor coined by Tiago Forte to describe the process of building a personal knowledge base, where you store your notes, ideas, and resources.

The Second Brain AI Assistant is an AI assistant that uses your Second Brain as a source of knowledge to answer questions, summarize documents, and provide insights.

As this is an educative open-source project, we will stick to Notion, but the code can be easily adapted to other sources, such as Google Drive, Calendar, etc.

As a fun (and relevant) example, we will provide you with our list of filtered resources (which we keep in Notion) on AI and ML, such as GenAI, LLMs, RAG, MLOps, LLMOps and information retrieval. Thus, using or giving access to your Notion is optional to take this course.

**What you'll do:**

- Build an agentic RAG application that uses your Second Brain as a source of knowledge.
- Architect an LLM and RAG system.
- Apply LLMOps and software engineering best practices.
- Fine-tune and deploy open-source LLMs.
- Leverage popular tools such as OpenAI, Hugging Face, MongoDB, ZenML, Opik, Comet, Unsloth, Crawl4AI, uv, ruff, smolagents, etc.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

While building the Second Brain AI assistant, we will cover the following concepts, algorithms and tools:

- Architecting an LLM system using the feature/training/inference (FTI) architecture.
- Using MLOps best practices such as data registries, model registries, and experiment trackers.
- Crawling over 700 links and normalizing everything into Markdown using Crawl4AI.
- Computing quality scores using LLMs.
- Generating summarization datasets using distillation.
- Fine-tuning a Llama model using Unsloth and Comet.
- Deploying the Llama model as an inference endpoint to Hugging Face serverless Dedicated Endpoints.
- Implement advanced RAG algorithms using contextual retrieval, hybrid search and MongoDB vector search.
- Build an agent that uses multiple tools using Hugging Face's smolagents framework.
- Using LLMOps best practices such as prompt monitoring and RAG evaluation using Opik.
- Integrate pipeline orchestration, artifact and metadata tracking using ZenML.
- Manage the Python project using uv and ruff. 

ü•∑ With these skills, you'll become a ninja in building **advanced RAG and LLM system using LLMOps and ML systems best practices**. 

## üë• Who Should Join?

**This course is ideal for:**
- ML/AI engineers interested in building production-ready RAG and LLM system
- Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and Software Engineers wanting to understand the engineering behind AI systems

**Note:** This course focuses on engineering practices and end-to-end system implementation rather than pure theory.

## üéì Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|
| **Skills** | Basic understanding of Python and Machine Learning. |
| **Hardware** | Any modern laptop/workstation will do the job (no GPU or powerful computing power required). We will show you how to use the cloud for lessons that require a GPU. |
| **Level** | Intermediate |


## üí∞ Cost Structure

All tools used throughout the course will stick to their free tier, except:

- OpenAI's API which follows a pay-as-you-go model taking us ~$3 to run the course.
- Hugging Face's Dedicated Endpoints which follows a pay-as-you-go model taking us ~$2 to run the course.

You can also **run the course with $0 costs** as we will **provide snapshots of the results for each module**.

## ü•Ç Open-source Course: Participation is Open and Free

As an open-source course, you don't have to enroll. Everything is self-paced, free of charge and with its resources freely accessible as follows:
- **code**: this GitHub repository
- **lessons**: [Decoding ML](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/build-your-second-brain-ai-assistant)

## üìö Course Outline

This **open-source course consists of 6 comprehensive modules** covering theory, system design, and hands-on implementation.

Our recommendation for getting the most out of this course:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Read the materials.
3. Setup the code and run it to replicate our results.
4. Go deeper into the code to understand the details of the implementation.

| Module | Materials | Description | Running the code | Audio |

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

While building the Second Brain AI assistant, we will build two separate Python applications:

```bash
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps / 
|   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/               # Docker infrastructure for the applications
|   |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ second-brain-offline/     # Offline ML pipelines
‚îî‚îÄ  ‚îî‚îÄ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ second-brain-online/      # Online inference pipeline = our AI assistant
```

## üëî Dataset

We will use our personal list of filtered resources (which we keep in Notion) on AI and ML, such as GenAI, LLMs, RAG, MLOps, LLMOps and information retrieval, containing ~100 pages and 700+ links which we will crawl and access from the Second Brain AI assistant.

![Notion data](./static/notion_genai_dataset.png)

For ease of use, we stored a snapshot of our Notion data in a public S3 bucket, which you can download for free without AWS credentials. 

Thus, you don't need to use Notion or hook your Notion to complete this course. But if you want to, you can, as we expose in this GitHub repository, a flexible pipeline that can load any Notion database. 

## üöÄ Getting Started

For detailed installation and usage instructions, see each application documentation that will walk you through how to setup everything and run the code for each module:
- [apps/second-brain-offline](apps/second-brain-offline)
- [apps/second-brain-online](apps/second-brain-online)

**Recommendation:** While you can follow the installation guide directly, we strongly recommend reading the accompanying articles to gain a complete understanding of what you'll build.

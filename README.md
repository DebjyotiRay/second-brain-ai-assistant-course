## 📖 About This Course

This course is part of Decoding ML's open-source series, where we provide free hands-on resources for building GenAI and information retrieval systems.

**The Second Brain AI Assistant**, in collaboration with [...](...), is a 6-module open-source course backed up by code and lessons that will teach you how to build an **advanced RAG and LLM system using LLMOps best practices**.

By the end of this course, you will know how to architect, build and deploy a production-ready RAG and LLM system, by building an end-to-end application from scratch: **The Second Brain AI Assistant**.

**What you'll do:**

1. ...

🥷 With these skills, you'll become a ninja in building **advanced RAG and LLM system using LLMOps and ML systems best practices**. 

## 👥 Who Should Join?

**This course is ideal for:**
- ML/AI engineers interested in building production-ready RAG and LLM system
- Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and Software Engineers wanting to understand the engineering behind AI systems

**Note:** This course focuses on engineering practices and end-to-end system implementation rather than pure theory.

## 🎓 Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|
| **Skills** | Basic understanding of Python and Machine Learning. |
| **Hardware** | Any modern laptop/workstation will do the job (no GPU or powerful computing power required). We will show you how to use the cloud for lessons that require a GPU. |
| **Level** | Intermediate |


## 💰 Cost Structure

All tools used throughout the course will stick to their free tier, except OpenAI's API, as follows:

- ...

## 🥂 Open-source Course: Participation is Open and Free

As an open-source course, you don't have to enroll. Everything is self-paced, free of charge and with its resources freely accessible as follows:
- **code**: this GitHub repository
- **lessons**: [Decoding ML](...)

## 📚 Course Outline

This **open-source course consists of 6 comprehensive modules** covering theory, system design, and hands-on implementation.

Our recommendation for getting the most out of this course:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Read the materials.
3. Setup the code and run it to replicate our results.
4. Go deeper into the code to understand the details of the implementation.

> [!NOTE]
> Check the [INSTALL_AND_USAGE](./INSTALL_AND_USAGE.md) doc for a step-by-step installation and usage guide.

| Module | Materials | Description | Running the code |
|--------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | [Build your Second Brain AI assistant](...) | Architect an AI assistant for your Second Brain. | **No code** |
| 2 | Data pipelines for building AI assistants (WIP) | Build a data pipeline to process Notion data, crawl new documents, compute a quality score using LLMs and ingest them to a NoSQL database. | - |
| 3 | Generate high-quality fine-tuning datasets (WIP) | Generate a high-quality summarization instruct dataset using distilation. | - |
| 4 | Fine-tune and deploy open-source LLMs (WIP) | Fine-tune an open-source LLM to specialize it in summarizing documents and deploy it as a real-time endpoint. | - |
| 5 | RAG feature pipelines for building AI assistants (WIP) | Implement an RAG feature pipeline using advanced techniques such as context retrieval. | - |
| 6 | Agents and LLMOps (WIP) | Implement the agentic inference pipeline together with an observation pipeline to monitor and evaluate the performance of the AI assistant. | - |

## 🏗️ Project Structure

While building the Second Brain AI assistant, we will build two separate Python applications:

```bash
.
├── apps / 
|   ├── infrastructure/           # Docker infrastructure for the applications
│   ├── second_brain_offline/     # Offline ML pipelines
│   ├── second_brain_online/      # Online inference pipeline = our AI assistant
```

## 👔 Dataset

...

## 🚀 Getting Started

For detailed installation and usage instructions, see each application documentation that will walk you through how to setup everything and run the code for each module:
- [apps/second_brain_offline](apps/second_brain_offline/README.md)
- [apps/second_brain_online](apps/second_brain_online/README.md)

**Recommendation:** While you can follow the installation guide directly, we strongly recommend reading the accompanying articles to gain a complete understanding of what you'll build.
